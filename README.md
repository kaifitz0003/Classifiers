# K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier using Scikit-learn
The algorithm finds the nearest neighbors based on the number of features we give it. Then, if we plot a point, the algorithm should be able to see which class it is in.

On the left, the plot shows the data with only one feature in a line. On the right, the plot shows the data with two features. 
The circles show the training data and the X shows the testing data in both plots.
